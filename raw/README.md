This folder contains the "raw" data from the sites (folder names), not 100% complete because icba with it and is mostly so i can look at older tag lists and see if i need them or how things changed i guess, though im probably going to upload *all but the posts* data from now on, so almost 100% complete i guess

And the above is because i added a "raw mode" to the script mentioned in the root repository, for danbooru at least, which can be found in the ["feat/raw-mode" branch](https://github.com/DraconicDragon/danbooru-e621-tag-list-processor/tree/feat/raw-mode)

the naming is basically (this doesnt apply to the older stuff from 2024 because i didnt bother at the time)

Folder - Year-Month-Day_UTC-TIME

UTC-TIME here meaning the creation date in UTC. For Danbooru creation date means the time at which the script was run while for e621 its the time displayed in [db_export index](https://e621.net/db_export/) (which i assume is UTC, heh)
